Recently because of lockdown so many things I am purchasing things from shop and paying money at the end of month.

I collected all the reciepts, and I started calculating at the end of the month. how much amount it cost to me for 1 month. I feel it is tough to me because i have lots of papers to count.

And I though to write a small programme to sum up all the values by putting them in file. and get a total sum of it.
